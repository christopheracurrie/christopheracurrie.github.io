#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom

When we were children  
Didn't it seem  
That the world was filled  
With wonderful things?  

A day at the park,  
A ride in the car,  
Mother and father,  
A house and the yard.  

Has the world grown weary  
Or is it just us?  
The ones who were hopeful  
Seem to banter and cuss.  

Shouldn't our children  
Deserve the same wonderful dreams?  
Or are nightmare economics  
The appropriate "In Thing"?  

I know it's not easy  
To be of positive mind  
But if we who are older  
Would only work on being pleasant and kind,  

Perhaps our children  
Would see the merits of dreams;  
A job that's productive,  
The American Thing.  

***We as Americans must have positive attitudes toward the future, so our children can too.
