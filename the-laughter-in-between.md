#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom
##The Laughter in Between
I watch my children play.
They bicker
And they fight
But there is laughter in between.

Parenting
Is not always
An easy practice.
Many experts know just how
Few practice what they preach.

Reflections on my past
Allow stories of
How I used to never,
Ever say or do that.

But as long
As laughter fills the space
Between the bickering and fighting,
My love will tolerate the childhood years.

My children sometimes
Play together so well
That I feel so proud
And good about whatever is going on.

But a request
To use the other's toy
Becomes a verbal fight
And I am incompetent once again.

I watch my children play.
They bicker
And they fight
But there is laughter in between.

***Parenting is not a perfect art; however, if laughter is heard, you're doing just fine.
