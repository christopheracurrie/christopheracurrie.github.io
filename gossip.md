#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom
 

<p align="center">

Gossip sometimes

Makes its way  

Into the cracks  

And crannies of our minds.  


It bypasses filters  

Built by time,  

Logic, thought,  

And a mature mind.  


It feeds  
On sadness,  
Moves  
On hate.  

It looks  
On people  
As an  
Utter waste.  

It sits on shoulders,  
Sleeps near nerves,  
Laughs at crying,  
Enjoys cross words.  

It plays magician  
And transforms lies  
Into stories  
About peoplesâ€™ lives.  

It has no manners,  
It has no friends,  
It needs no money,  
It just sits and grins.  

It loves to visit  
Old and young.  
It loves to shape  
What is said and sung.  

It sits on shoulders,  
Sleeps near nerves,  
Laughs at crying,  
Enjoys cross words.  

It bypasses filters  
Built by time,  
Logic, thought,  
And a mature mind.  

Gossip sometimes  
Makes its way  
Into the cracks  
And crannies of our mind.  
 
**Gossip is not hurt by your tears.
