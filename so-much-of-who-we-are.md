From the beginning  
We take on characteristics.  
Some are Mom's  
And some are Dad's.  

Our earliest words  
Are not hard,  
Yet they describe  
A parent's teachings.  

The wisdom  
Of the ages  
Is explained in terms  
That a child understands.  

And as we grow,  
Learning how  
To navigate the intricate world  
Of the adult,  

We become so aware  
That one of life's legacies –  
Our parent's blueprint – is  
So much of who we are.
