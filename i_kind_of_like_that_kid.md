##I Kind of Like That Kid
I kind of like that kid
Though he does
Some things
I don't like.

He has a face
That shows some hurt
And acts often
Like a jerk,

He is impulsive
And he lies,
Won't concentrate on work,
But all in all
I have to say
I kind of like that kid.

Someday is what
I see for him.
Someday when he will be
A citizen like you and me
Who sees the kinder side
Of human beings,

Looks into what
A child is all about,
Wanting to be liked.
I often say
When in doubt,

I kind of like that kid.
