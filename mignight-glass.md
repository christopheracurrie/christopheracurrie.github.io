It's almost midnight,
And we've had our little talk;
A talk that will end
With "Good night,"
With  "Good bye" understood

Strange to saying "Good night".
With  "Good bye" understood;
Strange to be saying "Good" anything
When I feel the way I do

The next time we meet, 
If ever we do, 
The years we spent together
Will be as empty as empty

"Good night," I say,
"Good bye," I understand.
It's midnight,
And the previous years have turned to glass
