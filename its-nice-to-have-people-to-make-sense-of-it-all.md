#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom

Whenever I wonder  
What person I am  
I look to the people  
On whose trust I depend.  

They know that my psyche  
Is fragile at times  
And a word of encouragement  
May weather the unkind.  

Life is a maze:  
You may run into walls;  
A clearing ahead  
May lead nowhere at all.  

But whenever you're troubled  
Or just need advice  
It's nice to have people  
To make sense of it all.  

Friendship's a bond  
Insured till it's gone  
The parties involved  
Must honor each other.

***Having people you can trust with your feelings is important.
