#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom

Do you believe in fairy tales?
That life remains at three.
If you believe in fairy tales,
Then come along with me.

Each of us searches for fairy tales;
Love's not real, you know?
But if you believe in fairy tales,
Love will believe in you.

Straight ahead a mountain stands;
A camping site for most.
But if you let your mind believe,
It's changed to candy rock.

And like the mountain changes,
Life becomes a play
Of little games of kisses
And never ending joy.

Do you believe in fairy tales?
That life remains at three?
If you believe in fairy tales,
Then come along with me.

***To Teach
It's good to remember what your child self believed.
