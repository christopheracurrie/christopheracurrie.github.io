#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom

Graduation Day is special.  
It’s meaningful and good.  
It’s mother, God, and Apple Pie.  
It’s achievement understood.  

It’s what we all believe in:  
That education shapes the mind,  
Molding our personalities  
And setting goals before our eyes.  

It’s filled with pomp and circumstance,  
Diplomas fill a box.  
Robes are on the graduates  
Who wait to start their march.  

The speeches are aglitter,  
With all that they have done.  
The students turn their tassels –  
A sign for everyone.  

The parents let their feelings  
Come surface with great joy.  
How often they had wondered  
About this graduation ploy.  

Graduation Day is special.  
It’s meaningful and good.  
It’s Mother, God, and Apple Pie.  
It’s achievement understood.  

***Students think graduations are for them, but they’re really for the parents.
