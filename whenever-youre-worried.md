Whenever you're worried
And ready to quit,
Life is a nightmare
Of unthinkable regret,

Remember you're loved
By many who care
Like mother and father,
Your sister and Bubba,
The lazy cat on the chair.

Life isn't always easy;
People sometimes aren't kind
But the beauty
Of living
Makes it worth the down times.

So don't let yourself
Make life so unfair.
You're one of our family:
Mother and father,
Your sister and Bubba,
The lazy cat on the chair.
