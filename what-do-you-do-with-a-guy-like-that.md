#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom

What do you do
With a guy like that
That’s  all messed up
From smoking crack?

He used to be
All nice and clean,
We never saw him
In wrinkled jeans.

Cousin Sally
Took him in,
He took some money
And made her scream.

She told him “go”
And felt a lot of guilt;
She remembered how
He used to be.

He’s okay now,
All locked up
In a mental ward – 
You can look right in.

He’ll never be
Quite the same
Though at times
It must bother him.

Memories of a past
That’s gone;
Mired in smoke,
Alcohol, and cruel accidents

What do you do
With a guy like that
That’s all messed up
From smoking crack?

He used to be
All nice and clean,
We never saw him
In wrinkled jeans.
