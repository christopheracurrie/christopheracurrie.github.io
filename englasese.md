She was almost ninety-five  
Until a year or two ago.  
Her strength was good  
And she moved about.  

I recall her liking  
To make her grandchildren food;  
Candy was always on the table  
And I ate many.  

Her Englasese was pretty good.  
An English word here and there  
Amongst lots of Japanese –  
Englasese.  

She liked to garden,  
Used to show us  
Her Japanese Eggplant  
Or beautiful flowers.  

It's time to say “bye”  
To the last of my grandparents.  
She awaits her last ceremony;  
The candy dish is empty.
