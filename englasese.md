<p align="center">She was almost ninety-five</p>  
<p align="center">Until a year or two ago.</p>  
<p align="center">Her strength was good</p>  
<p align="center">And she moved about.</p>  

<p align="center">I recall her liking</p>  
<p align="center">To make her grandchildren food;</p>  
<p align="center">Candy was always on the table</p>  
<p align="center">And I ate many.</p>  

<p align="center">Her Englasese was pretty good.</p>  
<p align="center">An English word here and there</p>  
<p align="center">Amongst lots of Japanese –</p>  
<p align="center">Englasese.</p>  

<p align="center">She liked to garden,</p>  
<p align="center">Used to show us</p>  
<p align="center">Her Japanese Eggplant</p>  
<p align="center">Or beautiful flowers.</p>  

<p align="center">It's time to say “bye”</p>  
<p align="center">To the last of my grandparents.</p>  
<p align="center">She awaits her last ceremony;</p>  
<p align="center">The candy dish is empty.</p>
