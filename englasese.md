She was almost ninety-five</br></br>  
Until a year or two ago.</br>  
Her strength was good</br>  
And she moved about.</br>  

I recall her liking</br>  
To make her grandchildren food;</br>  
Candy was always on the table</br>  
And I ate many.</br>  

Her Englasese was pretty good.</br>  
An English word here and there</br>  
Amongst lots of Japanese –</br>  
Englasese.</br>  

She liked to garden,</br>  
Used to show us</br>  
Her Japanese Eggplant</br>  
Or beautiful flowers.</br>  

It's time to say “bye”</br>  
To the last of my grandparents.</br>  
She awaits her last ceremony;</br>  
The candy dish is empty.</br>
