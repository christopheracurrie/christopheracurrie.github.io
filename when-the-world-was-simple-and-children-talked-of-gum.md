#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom

When the world  
was simple  
and children talked  
of gum,  

It seemed  
That we were capable  
of being  
anyone.  

One day  
you were a lawyer  
talking  
to the court,  

Another day  
a football player  
who became  
a motivating force.  

On Friday  
you were a business leader  
creating jobs  
for those who tried,  

And now  
I can introduce  
those children  
whose dreams  
have come alive.  

***Lawyers, athletes, and business people had big dreams.
