#Bits and Pieces from the American Classroom
##Little Blonde
Little Blonde
So funny,
Dimples side your cheeks.
Climbing sofa chair
With such imaginary ease.

Mother tells her,
"Baby, you be good."
And Little Blonde replies,
"Mama, I be good."

Little Blonde so funny,
Thirty years have passed,
And there she climbs on sofa chair,
Until the wine has passed.

***Everybody was little, relatively cute, and wonderful at one time.
